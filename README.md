## Hi, my name is Maxim!

### As a second-year student at RTU MIREA in Moscow, Russia, I am an enthusiastic server developer, proficient in Java, Spring, Git, SQL and REST. My dream is to develop large, efficient, scalable systems.
#### Everyday I try to improve and learn something new, delving into Spring, version control systems, databases, containerization, Linux, Kafka and other necessary technologies.
